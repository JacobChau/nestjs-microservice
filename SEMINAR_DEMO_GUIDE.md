# 🎭 Seminar Demo Guide - Scalable Ticket Booking System

## 🎯 **Demo Objective**
Show how **microservices + Kafka** solve real booking problems with **simple, clear examples** that anyone can understand.

---

## 🎪 **The Core Problem: Concert Ticket Booking**

### **Real-World Scenario**
> *"Taylor Swift concert has 100 seats. 3 users are trying to book the same seat at the same time. How do we prevent double-booking and handle the booking process properly?"*

### **Booking Process Flow**
1. **User selects seat** → Seat gets "reserved" (temporary hold)
2. **User enters payment** → Seat stays reserved during payment
3. **Payment succeeds** → Seat becomes "booked" (confirmed)
4. **Payment fails/timeout** → Seat becomes "available" again

---

## 🚀 **Demo 1: Concurrent Booking Conflict (5 minutes)**

### **The Story**
> *"3 users click on the same seat at exactly the same time. What happens?"*

### **Demo Steps**

#### **Step 1: Show the Problem**
```bash
# Open 3 Postman tabs (or use 3 different browsers)
# All 3 users try to book Seat A1 simultaneously

# User 1 (Postman Tab 1)
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A1"]
}

# User 2 (Postman Tab 2) - Same request at same time
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert", 
  "seatIds": ["A1"]
}

# User 3 (Postman Tab 3) - Same request at same time
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A1"]
}
```

#### **Step 2: Show the Results**
- **User 1**: ✅ Success - Seat reserved
- **User 2**: ❌ Error - "Seat already reserved"
- **User 3**: ❌ Error - "Seat already reserved"

#### **Step 3: Explain the Magic**
```bash
# Show Kafka messages that handled this
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic seat.reserved \
  --from-beginning
```

### **Key Points**
- ✅ **Only 1 user gets the seat** (no double-booking)
- ✅ **Kafka ensures message ordering** (first-come-first-served)
- ✅ **Database transactions** prevent race conditions
- ✅ **Other users get immediate feedback**

---

## ⏰ **Demo 2: Booking Timeout & Recovery (5 minutes)**

### **The Story**
> *"User 1 reserved seat A1 but disappeared without paying. After 10 minutes, the seat should become available again."*

### **Demo Steps**

#### **Step 1: Create a Reservation**
```bash
# User 1 books a seat
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A2"]
}

# Response: booking_id = "booking_123", status = "pending"
```

#### **Step 2: Show Seat is Reserved**
```bash
# Check seat availability
GET http://localhost:3000/events/taylor_swift_concert/seats

# Seat A2 shows status: "reserved"
```

#### **Step 3: Simulate Timeout (Fast Demo)**
```bash
# For demo purposes, we'll manually trigger timeout
# In real system, this happens automatically after 10 minutes

# Cancel the reservation (simulate timeout)
PUT http://localhost:3000/bookings/booking_123/cancel
```

#### **Step 4: Show Seat is Available Again**
```bash
# Check seat availability again
GET http://localhost:3000/events/taylor_swift_concert/seats

# Seat A2 shows status: "available" again
```

### **Key Points**
- ✅ **Automatic timeout handling** prevents seats being locked forever
- ✅ **Kafka events** notify all services about state changes
- ✅ **Real-time updates** keep seat availability accurate
- ✅ **Fair system** - abandoned reservations don't block others

---

## 💳 **Demo 3: Payment Flow & State Management (5 minutes)**

### **The Story**
> *"User successfully reserves a seat and goes through the complete payment process. Show how the system tracks each step."*

### **Demo Steps**

#### **Step 1: Reserve Seat**
```bash
# User books seat A3
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A3"]
}

# Response: booking_id = "booking_456", status = "pending"
```

#### **Step 2: Show Booking States**
```bash
# Check booking status
GET http://localhost:3000/bookings/booking_456

# Response shows:
# {
#   "id": "booking_456",
#   "status": "pending",
#   "seatIds": ["A3"],
#   "totalAmount": 150.00,
#   "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z"
# }
```

#### **Step 3: Complete Payment**
```bash
# User completes payment
PUT http://localhost:3000/bookings/booking_456/confirm
{
  "paymentId": "payment_789"
}

# Response: status = "confirmed"
```

#### **Step 4: Show Final State**
```bash
# Check final booking status
GET http://localhost:3000/bookings/booking_456

# Response shows:
# {
#   "id": "booking_456", 
#   "status": "confirmed",
#   "paymentId": "payment_789",
#   "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T10:05:00Z"
# }

# Check seat is now permanently booked
GET http://localhost:3000/events/taylor_swift_concert/seats
# Seat A3 shows status: "booked"
```

### **Key Points**
- ✅ **Clear state transitions**: pending → confirmed
- ✅ **Audit trail** of all booking changes
- ✅ **Payment integration** with booking system
- ✅ **Permanent seat allocation** after payment

## 🔧 **Demo 4: Service Resilience (3 minutes)**

### **The Story**
> *"The booking service crashes while users are trying to book tickets. What happens?"*

### **Demo Steps**

#### **Step 1: Normal Operation**
```bash
# Show normal booking works
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A4"]
}
# ✅ Success
```

#### **Step 2: Kill Booking Service**
```bash
# Simulate service crash
docker-compose stop booking-service
```

#### **Step 3: Try to Book**
```bash
# Try to book another seat
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A5"]
}

# Response: 
# {
#   "success": false,
#   "error": "Booking service temporarily unavailable"
# }
```

#### **Step 4: Show Kafka Persistence**
```bash
# Show that requests are queued in Kafka
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic booking.create \
  --from-beginning

# Messages are stored, waiting for service recovery
```

#### **Step 5: Restart Service**
```bash
# Restart the service
docker-compose start booking-service

# Wait 10 seconds, then try booking again
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A5"]
}
# ✅ Success - service recovered
```

### **Key Points**
- ✅ **Graceful error handling** when services are down
- ✅ **Message persistence** in Kafka during outages
- ✅ **Automatic recovery** when services restart
- ✅ **No data loss** even during failures

---

## 📊 **Demo 5: Real-time Updates (2 minutes)**

### **The Story**
> *"Multiple people are watching the same event page. When someone books a seat, everyone should see the update immediately."*

### **Demo Steps**

#### **Step 1: Open Multiple Windows**
```bash
# Open 2-3 browser windows with the real-time monitor
# File: demo-scripts/realtime-monitor.html
```

#### **Step 2: Book a Seat**
```bash
# Use Postman to book a seat
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
{
  "eventId": "taylor_swift_concert",
  "seatIds": ["A6"]
}
```

#### **Step 3: Watch Real-time Updates**
- All browser windows show seat count decrease immediately
- Activity log shows "Seat A6 booked for Taylor Swift concert"
- Progress bar updates to show new booking percentage

### **Key Points**
- ✅ **Event-driven architecture** enables real-time updates
- ✅ **All users see changes instantly** without refreshing
- ✅ **Kafka events** broadcast state changes
- ✅ **Scalable pub-sub pattern**

## 🎯 **Key Benefits Demonstrated**

### **Microservices Benefits**
1. **Service Independence** - Auth service works even if booking service is down
2. **Fault Isolation** - One service failure doesn't crash everything
3. **Scalability** - Can scale booking service independently during high demand
4. **Technology Choice** - Use best database for each service

### **Kafka Benefits**
1. **Message Ordering** - First-come-first-served for seat reservations
2. **Durability** - Booking requests survive service crashes
3. **Real-time Events** - Instant updates across all user interfaces
4. **Decoupling** - Services don't need to know about each other

### **Business Value**
- **No double-booking** = Happy customers
- **High availability** = More sales during peak times
- **Real-time updates** = Better user experience
- **Fault tolerance** = System works even during problems
