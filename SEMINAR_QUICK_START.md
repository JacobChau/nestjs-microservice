## 🎬 **5 Simple Demos (15 minutes total)**

### **Demo 1: Concurrent Booking (3 minutes)**
**Problem**: 3 users try to book the same seat simultaneously

**Steps**:
1. Open 3 Postman tabs
2. All try to book Seat A1 at the same time
3. Show only 1 succeeds, 2 get conflicts

**Key Point**: Kafka prevents double-booking

### **Demo 2: Booking Process (3 minutes)**
**Problem**: Show complete booking flow with state management

**Steps**:
1. Book Seat A2 → Status: "pending"
2. Check seat availability → Status: "reserved"
3. Confirm payment → Status: "confirmed"
4. Check final state → Status: "booked"

**Key Point**: Clear state transitions

### **Demo 3: Timeout Handling (2 minutes)**
**Problem**: User books seat but doesn't pay

**Steps**:
1. Book Seat A3 but don't pay
2. Show seat is reserved
3. Cancel booking (simulate timeout)
4. Show seat is available again

**Key Point**: Fair system, no seats locked forever

### **Demo 4: Service Resilience (4 minutes)**
**Problem**: Booking service crashes during operation

**Steps**:
1. Show normal booking works
2. Kill booking service: `docker-compose stop booking-service`
3. Try to book → Show graceful error
4. Restart service: `docker-compose start booking-service`
5. Try booking again → Show it works

**Key Point**: Fault isolation and recovery

### **Demo 5: Real-time Updates (3 minutes)**
**Problem**: Multiple users need instant updates

**Steps**:
1. Open multiple browser windows with real-time monitor
2. Book seats using Postman
3. Watch all windows update instantly

**Key Point**: Event-driven architecture

## 🎯 **Key Messages for Your Audience**

### **The Problems We Solve**
1. **Double-booking** when multiple users book same seat
2. **Abandoned bookings** locking seats forever
3. **System crashes** during peak demand
4. **Delayed updates** across user interfaces

### **How Microservices + Kafka Solve Them**
1. **Message ordering** prevents race conditions
2. **Automatic timeouts** release abandoned seats
3. **Fault isolation** keeps system running during failures
4. **Event-driven updates** provide real-time synchronization

### **Real-World Impact**
- **Ticketmaster** handles millions of concurrent users
- **Airlines** prevent double-booking of seats
- **Hotels** manage room reservations
- **E-commerce** handles flash sales

## 📱 **Demo Commands Reference**

### **Setup Commands**
```bash
# Start everything
./demo-scripts/seminar-setup.sh

# Load environment variables
source .demo-env

# Check services are running
docker-compose ps
```

### **Demo Commands**
```bash
# Demo 1: Concurrent booking (use 3 Postman tabs)
POST http://localhost:3000/bookings
Headers: Authorization: $USER1_TOKEN
Body: {"eventId":"$EVENT_ID","seatIds":["A1"]}

# Demo 2: Check booking status
GET http://localhost:3000/bookings/$BOOKING_ID

# Demo 3: Confirm payment
PUT http://localhost:3000/bookings/$BOOKING_ID/confirm
Body: {"paymentId":"payment_demo_123"}

# Demo 4: Service resilience
docker-compose stop booking-service
# Try booking (shows error)
docker-compose start booking-service
# Try booking again (works)

# Demo 5: Real-time updates
# Open demo-scripts/realtime-monitor.html
# Book seats and watch updates
```

### **Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Check Kafka messages
docker exec -it kafka kafka-console-consumer \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --topic booking.create

# Check service logs
docker-compose logs booking-service

# Check all services
docker-compose ps
```

## 🎪 **Presentation Script**

### **Opening (1 minute)**
> *"Imagine buying Taylor Swift tickets. The website shows 1 seat left. You and 2 other people click 'Buy' at exactly the same time. What happens? Let's see how modern systems handle this chaos..."*

### **Main Demos (12 minutes)**
- Run each demo as outlined above
- Explain the technical concepts simply
- Show the business value

### **Closing (2 minutes)**
> *"This is how companies like Ticketmaster handle millions of users. Microservices provide scalability and fault tolerance. Kafka ensures consistency and real-time updates. Together, they solve the hardest problems in high-demand booking systems."*

## 🎉 **Success Criteria**

Your demo will be successful if you can show:

1. ✅ **3 users trying to book same seat** → Only 1 succeeds
2. ✅ **Complete booking flow** → pending → confirmed
3. ✅ **Service failure and recovery** → System keeps working
4. ✅ **Real-time updates** → All browsers update instantly
5. ✅ **Clear explanations** → Audience understands the benefits

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Services Don't Start**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker --version

# Restart everything
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs
```

### **If API Doesn't Respond**
```bash
# Wait longer for services to start
sleep 30

# Check API Gateway
curl http://localhost:3000/events

# Restart API Gateway
docker-compose restart api-gateway
```

### **If Postman Doesn't Work**
```bash
# Check environment variables are loaded
echo $EVENT_ID
echo $USER1_TOKEN

# Reload environment
source .demo-env

# Use curl instead
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/bookings \
  -H "Authorization: $USER1_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"eventId":"'$EVENT_ID'","seatIds":["A1"]}'
```
